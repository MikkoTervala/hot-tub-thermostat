# Functionality

The system acts as a thermostat controlling temperature of an outdoor hot tub. The hot tub is heated with a natural gas instant lake water heater. As temperature goes down, the thermostat will let more hot water in. The thermostat will be installed near the water heater, so a wireless temperature sensor is used to avoid wires.
